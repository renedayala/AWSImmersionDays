    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",

    "This notebook presents an example problem to predict if a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank, after one or more phone calls.  The steps include:\n",

    "* Preparing your Amazon SageMaker notebook\n",
    "* Downloading data from the internet into Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "* Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed to Amazon SageMaker algorithms\n",

    "This example analyzed a relatively small dataset, but utilized Amazon SageMaker features such as distributed, managed training and real-time model hosting, which could easily be applied to much larger problems.  In order to improve predictive accuracy further, we could tweak value we threshold our predictions at to alter the mix of false-positives and false-negatives, or we could explore techniques like hyperparameter tuning.  In a real-world scenario, we would also spend more time engineering features by hand and would likely look for additional datasets to include which contain customer information not available in our initial dataset."
